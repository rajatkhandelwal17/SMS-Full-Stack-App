Student Management App (Angular Frontend):

This frontend is responsible for fetching the data from backend API, but which is not yet read.
Hence we will just create the REST service with blank implementation of methods.
Once the backend is ready make HTTP calls using HTPP modules.

TODO - Omce the backend is ready make http call with http module.
TODO - Create backend service for this front end.
Now The blank implementation is not more we have put it on our http link.
